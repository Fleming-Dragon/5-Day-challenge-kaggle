    "# Day 2 - Document Q&A with RAG using Chroma\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The Day 1 notebook contains lots of information for getting set up with Kaggle Notebooks. If you are having any issues, please [check out the troubleshooting steps there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting#Get-started-with-Kaggle-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indexing\n",
    "2. Retrieval\n",
    "3. Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.\n",
